# BST

My implementation of a Binary Search Tree in Java.

This is implemented with an interface, so that features can be added at a later time.

## How to run

Download/Clone the repo, enter the src folder and type

```
$ javac *.java && java BSTMain.java
```

in your terminal window and the main file will start some _"tests"_ to make sure all features are working correctly.

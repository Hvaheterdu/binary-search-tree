# BST

My implementation of a Binary Search Tree in Java 17.

This is implemented with an interface so new features can be added later.

## How to run

Download/Clone the repo, enter the src folder and type the command below in the Terminal/Powershell window.

```
$ javac *.java && java BSTMain.java
```

The main file will start some _"tests"_ to ensure all features are working correctly.
